Monte Carlo pi
==========

Program estimates pi based on the Monte Carlo method of estimating the area in a quarter of a circle of radius 1 centered at (0,0).  The program runs a simulation for each thread the system supports or one if multithreading is not enabled. It then runs the same number of simulations without threading them.
